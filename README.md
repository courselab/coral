 Coral - Snake game challenge
 ==============================

 Coral is intended as a programming exercise.

 It consists of a very simple version of the classic 80s arcade snake game
 written in Python, provided as an initial codebase that the learner should
 further extend. It was originally created as an educational resource to teach
 open-source development practices, tools, and project management methodologies
 to graduate computer science students. 

 The exercise consists of:

 a) Fixing the listed known issues (bugs and requested features).

 b) Improving the game by adding some exciting new features.

 Important information for developers can be found in the file
 docs/CONTRIBUTING.md. Please read it before starting your contribution.

  - Windows/Mac Users: You can download it from the official Python [website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  

 - Pygame: This project uses the  `pygame 2.6.0` library, python's package manager `pip` or other package manager of your choice.

 ### Installation Steps
 
 1. Clone the repository:

 First, clone the Coral repository to your local machine by running the following command in your terminal:

 ```bash
 git clone git@github.com:courselab/coral.git
 ``` 

 2. Navigate to the project folder: Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the `coral` folder:
 
 ```bash
 cd coral
 ```

 3. Install dependencies: To install the required dependencies, you'll need to install Pygame. Run the following command:
 
 - Using pip (recommended for most users):
 
 ```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```

 - Using `pacman` (for Arch Linux):

 ```bash
 sudo pacman -S python-pygame
 ```

- Using `nix`:

To create a development shell with all dependencies installed: `Ç¹ix develop`

To create a shell to simply run the game: `nix run`
